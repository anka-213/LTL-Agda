# LTL-Agda
Implementation based off Huth &amp; Ryan's LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

We are trying stay as close to the source text as possible. 

Anka's version is a shallow embedding following "An Axiomatization of Linear Temporal Logic in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions", by Solange Coupet-Grimal.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8133459

LTL.agda is deeply embedded and we will merge the shallow embedded version soon, as the semantic evaluation function is being written now.

TODO : Complete definition, prove decidability, and link to some external SAT/SMT solver.
